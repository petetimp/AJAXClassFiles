<title>Arrays</title>
<!--Arrays are very powerful in JavaScript.

The Array object can be instantiated using a constructor
call or a literal. The array indices must be positive 
integers, but the values stored in an array can be of 
any type or reference to any object.

We can create new arrays using the new Array constructor
or a literal (using square brackets).-->
<script type="text/javascript">
	//constructor call
	var cities = new Array(); //cities.length will be 0
	cities[0] = "Albuquerque"; //cities.length will be 1
	cities[9] = "Tampa"; //cities.length will be 10
	
	 //literal syntax
	var teams = [ "Cubs","Yankees","Mariners" ];
	alert(teams.length); // 3

	var bands = [];
	alert(bands.length); // 0
	bands["rock"] = ["Beatles","Rolling Stones","Pink Floyd"];
	bands["punk"] = ["Sex Pistols","Ramones","Dead Kennedys"];
	alert(bands.length); // 0
	bands["1992"] = ["Nirvana","Pearl Jam","Soundgarden","Metallica"];
	alert(bands.length); // 1993
/*Things to note:

The array index starts at 0 in JavaScript
Arrays can be initialized with values or without values 
using the literal syntax.

The array length is always one greater than the highest 
numerical index. You should ensure your indices are 
continuos positive numbers if you are going to loop over
the values in the array using the for (var i=0; i
<myarray.length; ++i) {} approach.*/
